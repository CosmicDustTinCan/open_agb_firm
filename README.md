# open_agb_firm

open_agb_firm is a bare metal app for running GBA homebrew/games using the 3DS builtin GBA hardware.

## Disclaimer
We are not responsible for any damage that may occur to your system as a direct or indirect result of you using open_agb_firm.

## How to build
To compile open_agb_firm you need
* [devkitARM](https://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/)
* [Corelink DMA-330 assembler](https://github.com/profi200/dma330as)
* [CTR firm builder](https://github.com/derrekr/ctr_firm_builder)

installed in your system. Additionally you need 7-Zip or on Linux p7z installed to make release builds. Also make sure the CTR firm builder and dma330as binaries are in your $PATH environment variable and accessible to the Makefile. Build open_agb_firm as debug build via `make` or as release build via `make release`.

## Known issues
This section is reserved for a listing of known issues. At present only this remains:
* Sleep mode is not fully implemented.
* Save type detection may still fail for certain games using EEPROM.
* No settings (including brightness control), no cheats and other enhancements.

If you happen to stumble over another bug, please open an issue in the [official open_agb_firm repo on GitHub](https://github.com/profi200/open_agb_firm/issues) or contact me via other platforms.

## Hardware limitations
This is a list of limitations we can't solve in software or are very hard to work around. This doesn't mean it will never happen (unless stated otherwise).
* 64 MiB (512 mbit) games. Not possible to support.
* Games with extra hardware built into the cartridge (except Real-Time Clock). Patches are required.
* GBA Serial port (aka. Link Cable).
* 64 KiB (512 kbit) SRAM (homebrew games/emulators). Not possible to support.
* Can't switch back to 3DS mode from GBA mode requiring a reboot for booting a different game.
* Savestates. Very difficult to implement because no direct hardware access.

## Troubleshooting
Known problems and the solution.

Problem: The game crashes/shows white or blackscreens or shows a savegame corrupt message.\
Solution: Try to delete the savegame file. If this doesn't help report the issue.\
Note: EEPROM saves made by some emulators are incompatible because they have every 8 bytes block endian swapped.
